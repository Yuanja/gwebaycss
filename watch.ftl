                                                                            <p>Welcome to my Ebay shop where I have been trading safely since 2003. Thank you for visiting and for taking the time to read about me and what I do...</p>
                                                                            <p>I have been dealing in fine watches since I was just 14, way back in 1975. Over the years I have made many friends within the trade all around the world, and it's quite likely that anyone you know within this business will know about me, how I work and my long standing reputation within the watch and jewellery industry.</p>
                                                                            <p>In my time I have had three "bricks and mortar" High Street shops but am now in (semi) retirement and have reverted to dealing mainly online and on Ebay.</p>
                                                                            <p>This business is now a hobby for me rather than a necessity and these days I spend most of my time supplying other dealers, their shops and the trade in general but I still enjoy dealing with the public. The lack of overheads now means that I can be more competitive than ever which is great news for everyone.</p>
                                                                            <p>Of course, all of my old and regular customers know that I'm someone who can be trusted 100% but I understand that new customers might feel uneasy dealing with someone who works online rather than from a shop premises. This is totally understandable and why I encourage you to contact me personally before making a purchase.</p>
                                                                            <p>All of my golden and key customer ethos practices are known within the industry. I treat every customer how I'd expect to be treated myself, and my personal aim in life is to try and make people happy.</p>
                                                                            <p>I believe you will only hear good things about me and what I do. If you'd like a chat before making a purchase then please feel free to give me a call on either 01342 317536 or 07710 444459 and I will be happy to offer you free and friendly advice.</p>
                                                                            <p>Meanwhile I hope you enjoy my Ebay shop and I sincerely look forward to serving you soon.</p>
