I sold this watch to a collector in 2012 and have just secured its return to stock. Condition is excellent, usual light surface marks commensurate with age and authenticity.Video of watch is also available. Please feel free to call for further information.Please review my sales history and feedback here on Ebay where I have been selling Rolex watches since 2003 and within the watch industry since 1975. Thank you for looking, <em> &#8212; Paul.</em></p>

                                                                            <p>Welcome to my Ebay shop where I have been trading safely since 2003. Thank you for visiting and for taking the time to read about me and what I do...</p>
                                                                            <p>I have been dealing in fine watches since I was just 14, way back in 1975. Over the years I have made many friends within the trade all around the world, and it's quite likely that anyone you know within this business will know about me, how I work and my long standing reputation within the watch and jewellery industry.</p>
                                                                            <p>In my time I have had three "bricks and mortar" High Street shops but am now in (semi) retirement and have reverted to dealing mainly online and on Ebay.</p>
                                                                            <p>This business is now a hobby for me rather than a necessity and these days I spend most of my time supplying other dealers, their shops and the trade in general but I still enjoy dealing with the public. The lack of overheads now means that I can be more competitive than ever which is great news for everyone.</p>
                                                                            <p>Of course, all of my old and regular customers know that I'm someone who can be trusted 100% but I understand that new customers might feel uneasy dealing with someone who works online rather than from a shop premises. This is totally understandable and why I encourage you to contact me personally before making a purchase.</p>
                                                                            <p>All of my golden and key customer ethos practices are known within the industry. I treat every customer how I'd expect to be treated myself, and my personal aim in life is to try and make people happy.</p>
                                                                            <p>I believe you will only hear good things about me and what I do. If you'd like a chat before making a purchase then please feel free to give me a call on either 01342 317536 or 07710 444459 and I will be happy to offer you free and friendly advice.</p>
                                                                            <p>Meanwhile I hope you enjoy my Ebay shop and I sincerely look forward to serving you soon.</p>
